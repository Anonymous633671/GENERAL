# How to GENERALize Across Many Software Projects?(with case studies on Predicting Defect and Project Health

## Abstract:
Despite decades of research, SE lacks widely accepted models (that offer precise quantitative predictions) about  what factors most influence software quality. This paper provides a "good news" result that such general models can be generated using a new transfer learning framework called "GENERAL". Given a tree of recursively clustered project data, GENERAL promotes a model upwards if it performs best in the lower clusters (stopping when the promoted model performs worse than the models seen at a lower level). 

The number of models found by GENERAL  is minimal: one for  defect prediction (across 756 projects) and less than a dozen for project health (across 1628 projects). Hence, via GENERAL, it is possible to make conclusions that  hold across hundreds of projects at a time.  Further, the models produced in this manner offer predictions that perform as well or better than prior studies.
